## Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio

This page includes some of the projects that have interested me and my work applying my data science knowledge and techniques in order to gain insights hidden in the data and to develop models that can help to predict outcomes that can be used to inform decisions in the future. Data science is a very broad and constantly evolving field and I have tried to explore techniques in data visualization and manipulation, machine learning modelling and natural language processing.
