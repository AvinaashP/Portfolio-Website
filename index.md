<div style="text-align: justify">I scrapped 200,000 tweets that contained the word Cardano to be able to analyze the sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency during a time of rapid price increase to see if there was any interesting patterns that I could find. This project allowed me to make use of NLP techniques like regex functions to clean up the tweets and data visualization and manipulation to create graph that could show the value of sentiment surrounding Cardano from August 08 2021 to August 31 2021. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> Using data sourced from IBM sample datasets, the Telco dataset includes customer information from a telcommunications company that provides internet and phones services. The aim of the dataset is to create a model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn. I thought the dataset would be a good opportunity to practice applying problem solving solutions to real world business problems and allow me to apply data visualization and statistical testing techniques that would shine more light on to the dataset. I applied two different gradient boosting model in XGBoost and Catboost and while the performances were close, Catboost edged on XGBoost on recall metrics  </div>
